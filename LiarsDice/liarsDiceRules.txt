				              Liar's Dice Rules
-The first player calls out two numbers: first, how many dice on the table he or she thinks have
been rolled as a number between one and six. For example, player one could say “two fives,”
which means he or she thinks there are at least two dice that are fives among all the players’
dice (including his or her own).
-At this point, all players can accept what has been called out and move on to player two
or call player one out, which will end the round and result in a winner or loser for the
round.
-If player one calls out “two fives,” it does not matter whether player one has a five or not as
bluffing is allowed in Liar’s Dice. It only matters if another player believes player one is bluffing
and calls him or her out on it. In that instance, all dice must be revealed. If player one is correct,
the player wins. If player one is wrong, then the player who called him/her out is the winner.
The round is then over.
-If player one’s call is accepted, then player two calls out a number. The first number must be
greater than what player one called. For example, if player one called out “two fives,” player
two must call out three or higher for his or her first number, so “three fives,” “three fours,” or
four twos” would all be acceptable. “One five” or “two sixes” would be unacceptable.
-Game play continues until someone is called out.
